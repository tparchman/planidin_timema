# Timema 2023 GBS
# Organization and Workflow for *Timema* 2023 GBS - Planidin PhD set 
Organizational notes and code for two sequencing sets:
- rangewide sampling for landscape genomic analyses
- sequencing of indivuals from provenance trials

# Range-wide landscape genomics: sample organization and GBS workflow 

## Sample organization
- Full information on DNAs for each individual sampled across natural distribution can be found in `XXXX`. This file also has the updated plate maps with specified IDs.

- barcode key files correspond with LIB1 (plates 1-6; `barcode_info_XXXX.csv`) and LIB2 (plates 7-12; `barcode_info_XXXX.csv`).

- **NOTE** 

## GBS workflow

- All organizational information, and notes on lab workflow are in `/Documents/GitHub/planidin_timema/README.md`.

## Notes on library preparation

**NEED TO DO**: anneal more MSE adaptors, order iproof (have martinson order a tube), order ladder

### 3/23-4/19: R/L and PCR for plates 1-6. Master mix in `timema23_RFseq_mastermixcockatils.xlsx`.

### 4/23-4/28: R/L and PCR for plates 1-6. Master mix in `timema23_RFseq_mastermixcockatils.xlsx`.

## Data analysis: contaminant cleaning, barcode parsing, data storage.
